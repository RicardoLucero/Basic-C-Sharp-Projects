# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

## Here are a sample of some small projects I created during my C# and .NET Framework course.


- Car Insurance
- Console app assignment
- TechAcadStudentsMVC
- TryCatch

### Car Insurance
This Project is about a Car Insurance app that is created using and MVC model. It has a webpage to have users enter in their information and with some business logic it calculates a quote to give the user. We also have an Admin page for staff to use to see the quotes that have been issued to who. The admin page gives their first name, last name, email address and as stated the quote amount.

### Console app assignment
This is a console app that goes through many different types of loops to iterate the list items and display them to the console. The first loop initializes a string array and then asks for user input. Then it iterates through the array and concatanates to the items. The second loop ask for a number from the user between 1-10 and there is a while loop that while the input number is unser 10 it will increment and loop through again. The third loop is another while loop and does almost the same as the second loop. The fourth loop is similar as to it being a while loop. The fifth loop is a for loop. We ask the user to give us a word and it will use that word to iterate though a list and search through the list to find the word. If it does not find the word it asks for another word. The seventh loop is a foreach loop that has two lists and the first list has city names one of the cities is a duplicate and we iterate though to get only unique names to add to the second list.

### TechAcadStudentsMVC
Now this is another MVC project that multiple views to see the instructors to this school and ties them to students so they are able to see who thier instructors are. the multiple views has the list for what subjects the instructors teach and using parameters is how they tie to the students. Created a seperate controller to show the views of the instructors and have the logic for how to display the views.

### TryCatch
this project is another console app that has exception handling with a try catch block. The app is used to find out the users birth year. The try catch block ensures that the user is putting in a valid birthday examples of non valid birthdays would be negative numbers or entering zero. We make our own exception messages to let the user know why it was thrown and that they have an idea of what to do the next try.
